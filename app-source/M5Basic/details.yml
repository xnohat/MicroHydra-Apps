short_description: A BASIC interpreter and REPL

description: |
  Nothing pairs better than BASIC and a card computer. 

  M5Basic implements a simple BASIC interpreter and REPL, with a nostalgic flavor of the 1980s. 

  Note that the documentation is in the comments at the beginning of **M5Basic.py**, and some functionalities still require stability improvements.
